Merlin Goes grew up with a standard if not above average comsopolitan family. Well cared for and loved, he signed onto a union flight as medical staff with the intent to tour the galaxy after completing his degrees in medicine and biology at a smith-shimano academy. However due to a clerical error with his Union application he ended up being assigned to a diplomatic escort, followed by a very dense crash-course in piloting. During the ensuing delays to correcting his application he'd discovered an enjoyment for piloting, and decided to stick with it (especially given the ship was already long outside of union space by this time). 
Soon after being assigned to his current post the error was corrected, but were unable to rotate him from being a supply hand to the medical bays due to short staffing during the flight.
