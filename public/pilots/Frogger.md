Letter of Commendation: Award pending; "I Submit this request for a LoC for Frogger due to his immense bravery and willingness to volunteer to be the solo flank unit at the battle of the Nov Elysia rail yard. Due to his actions pulling enemy forces away from the main objective and distracting them on flank the rest of his squad was allowed to advance with less resistance. His presence on the flank also allowed for Hermes to Dance the tango with the main escort force withough taking excessive fire from other units. - NHP Rio
