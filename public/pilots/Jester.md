While growing up and always having a knack for tech he eventually scored a job with **Horus** as a **intel officer** leading intel and providing strategic advice to the boots on the ground, this led to him working intel during the **Tragedy of Hercynia** around 4560u where he dicovered bits and pieces of intel relating to the **spartan project**. Shortly after this discovery something happened causing him to get stuck in a **rift** with blink space bascially removing him from existence. While in this space he stopped aging and time stopped around him. He eventually found a way to escape this fold landing him in the current year of 5023u, with no knowldge of the current world he enlisted with union as a intel officer in order to gain access to the current worlds informational stores.
