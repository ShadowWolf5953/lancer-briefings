# Mission // #001
## The-Drop
# Goals
- Land at Forward Operating
Base Saber and await further orders.

# Parameters
- Unknown at this time. Hostile
forces are confirmed to be operating
within Nov Elysia, so anticipate enemy
contact; you are cleared to engage if
fired upon.

# Stakes
- Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a
timely fashion will result in delays, setting
the operation's timetable back and
potentially narrowing the window of
opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and
Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Rewards
- Once the players arrive at FOB Saber,
the situation on the ground will be
evaluated and field upgrades distributed
accordingly.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
