# Mission // #002
## Day Break
# Goals
- Neutralize the enemyâ€™s comms
jamming network, then locate and secure
Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Parameters
- Intel places the nearest
transmitter within a nearby financial/
commercial district. The area is densely
packed with tall buildings, and there are
reports that the Vestan Sovereignty has
begun to deploy air assets in defense of
its strongpoints throughout the city. The
existence of the jamming network also
indicates that the Sovereignty forces have
significant electronic warfare assets at
their disposal; anticipate systemic
invasion and localized sensor jamming/
optical camouflage-equivalent capabilities.

# Stakes
- If the squad fails to neutralize the enemy
jamming network on schedule, the LSA
advance into Nov Elysia's central district
will face heavy resistance, incurring
serious casualties which may hinder their
ability to retake the city effectively.
Should they then fail to locate and
secure Captain Farris and Ambassador
Bannerjee, it will likely result in them
being taken prisoner or even killed.

# Rewards
- Following this mission, the Squads actions
will be recognized, earning them a
promotion to LL2. Mission success may
also grant them access to additional
prototype Exotic Gear that they can then
utilize during future missions to come.

# Reserves
- May be aquired during the events of downtime within the fob.
