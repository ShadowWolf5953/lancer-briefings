While Navigating to the original rally point at FOB Saber, the squad stumbled upon a squad of **LSA foot soldiers** attempting to repair a bus full of civilians, Squad lead **Wild Turkey** Determined it wouldn't ultimately affect the squad's mission to provide assistance. After establishing a defensive perimeter **Hermes** and **Frogger** were instructed to scout out the safest route for the bus to the evacuation bunker. While they stepped out, **Derringer** and **Wild Turkey** worked to repair the bus as **Jester** kept his eyes locked on sensors to alert of any incoming enemies. Once the 2 returned from scouting they set out with the bus and managed to escort it to the bunker. However they did run into a couple of random Sovereignty patrols but did not suffer any casualties. As thanks the squad was asked to stay and get some hot rations and resupply. They also received coordinates for a rail station not to far away that would help them get to the fob in half the time.

After arriving at the FOB and running into **SSGT Garcia** whos drop ship were one of the few to make it through the barrage of anti-air fire thanks to the expert piloting skills of Shogi squads pilot call sign **Silence**, they are then introduced to Vonna the lead mechanic of the FOB and told to get repaired. While their mechs are being re outtfitted and repaired the squad will have some downtime to be able to explore the FOB which has now become one of the major fronts against the Sovereignty.
